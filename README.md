# Trion

## Trivia: where did the name "Trion" come from?

The term trion came from a book by StanisÅ‚aw Lem (Polish renown futurologist and science fiction writer, 12 or 13 Sept 1921 - 27 Mar 2006), titled 'The Magellanic Cloud' (1955). The single trion is a content holder, which can store not only text and images, that can be easily displayed afterwards, but also voice and music and even scents. A collection of trions ('Trion Library') was a unimagineably huge database, to which all members of society had direct and instant access and could search for and consume the content. This is the basic function of Internet nowadays for many of it's users, though we're still waiting for the format of scent holder ;-)

In his non-fiction work of philosophy, 'Dialogs' (1957, English translation: Frank Prengel) mr Lem foresaw the creation of global network. He lived to see that prediction to come to live and commented on it:

> Until I used the Internet I wasn't aware, that there are so many idiots in the world
